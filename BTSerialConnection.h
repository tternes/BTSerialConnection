/**
 BTSerialConnection is simple API for writing and receiving data from serial devices.
 
 Messages are automatically received from the connected device in the background, simplifying
 the asynchronous receive process. Received messages or data is delivered through delegate methods, 
 and can be redirected to the appropriate thread or operation queue as needed by an application.
 
 Messages are received by implementing at least one of the BTSerialConnectionDelegate messages.
